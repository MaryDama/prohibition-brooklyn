# Booze in Brooklyn: Pre-prohibition alcohol production  
King’s County Distillery, established in 2010, claims to be the “oldest whiskey distillery in Brooklyn” because of how lasting the effects of prohibition were on alcohol production in this borough. We’re interested in knowing which neighborhoods felt these effects most.

As our primary data source in this investigation, we're using the Brooklyn Public Library collection of digitized Brooklyn city and business directories for the period 1856-1967, specifically Upington's General Directory of the Borough of Brooklyn, 1908. By using python to read this directory, parse it, and write the relevant lines to CSV, then importing said CSV into the Google My Maps tool, we intend to map the distilleries and breweries in Brooklyn, showing where the areas of production were prior to prohibition.
