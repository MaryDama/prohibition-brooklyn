# Booze in Brooklyn: Visualizing pre-prohibition alcohol production  
King’s County Distillery, established in 2010, claims to be the “oldest whiskey distillery in Brooklyn” because of how lasting the effects of prohibition were on alcohol production in this borough. We’re interested in knowing which neighborhoods felt these effects most.

As our primary data source in this investigation, we used digitized Brooklyn city and business directories available on Internet Archive. By using python to read our three chosen directories (listed and linked below), parse them, and write the relevant lines to CSV, then importing said CSV into Google My Maps, we mapped the distilleries and breweries in Brooklyn, showing where the areas of production were prior to prohibition.
